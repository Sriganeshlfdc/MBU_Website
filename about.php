                            <p>Born on 31 January 1673, Louis-Marie Grignion—affectionately known as  Montfort—emerged as a 
                                prophetic voice of his time. He recognized the presence  of God in the poor and dedicated his entire 
                                life to their upliftment. From within  him flowed an unfailing stream of love, courage, selfless service, 
                                and deep  commitment to the marginalized and the downtrodden. At the heart of this  inexhaustible 
                                zeal was his guiding motto: “<span>God Alone</span> ”.
                            </p>
                            <p>Montfort entered eternal life on 28 April 1716, yet his spirit continues to inspire the world today 
                                through the three congregations he founded—the Montfort Brothers of St. Gabriel, the Priests of the 
                                Company of Mary (Montfort Fathers), and the Daughters of Wisdom—as well as through numerous
                                Montfortian Associates who keep his mission alive.

                            <p>The Congregation of the Montfort Brothers of St. Gabriel forms a vibrant religious community within the Catholic Church. Founded by St. Louis-Marie de Montfort, the Brothers are consecrated religious inspired by Jesus Christ. They profess the vows of poverty, chastity, and obedience, choosing to live in communities where everything is shared and no member claims anything as his own.

                        <p>Education remains one of the congregation’s primary ministries, with a special focus on children and youth—particularly those from disadvantaged backgrounds. The Brothers’ educational mission goes beyond academic excellence. It seeks the holistic formation of young people through discipline, hard work, and strong moral and spiritual values. Their approach aims to prepare youth for life by promoting maturity, scientific thinking, healthy competition, cooperation, and true sportsmanship. Equally important is nurturing sensitivity to the needs and rights of others—especially the poor—along with religious tolerance and a spirit of national integration.The congregation works collaboratively with like-minded organizations, governmental and non-governmental, to develop God-loving, responsible, and competent citizens. Their efforts form part of a broader vision of human resource development rooted in dignity, compassion, and service.</p>

                            <p>While the congregation places great emphasis on formal schooling, it also invests significantly in technical education for young people. The Brothers are equally committed to social and community development, engaging in grassroots initiatives, social work, and advocacy for the upliftment of the poor, the marginalized, and the oppressed. These activities form an integral part of their Montfortian mission.</p>
